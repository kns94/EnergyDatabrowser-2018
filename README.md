# Energy Databrowser 2018

This repository contains work done to build an updated version of the original
[Energy Export Databrowser](http://mazamascience.com/OilExport/).

This project is sponsored by Mazama Science and co-sponsored by the Open Data Literacy project at the University of
Washington's [iSchool](https://ischool.uw.edu/).

## Databrowser Background

From the original databrowser [About Page](http://mazamascience.com/OilExport/about.html):

> Access to fossil fuels is one of the most important issues of our time. The world's largest economies are extremely
> dependent upon imported supplies of oil and gas. Understanding who produces and consumes oil, coal and natural gas
> is critical today and will remain so in the years ahead.

> This databrowser uses data from the 2017 BP Statistical Review and displays coal, oil & natural gas production
> and consumption timelines for each country in the database and several political and geographic groupings of nations.
> Users can dynamically plot import/export curves to get a sense of who the major fossil fuel producers and consumers
> are and how this has changed in the last four decades.
